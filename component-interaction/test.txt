There are 4 methods to share data between components in angular:

- Parent to Child: Sharing Data via Input
- Child to Parent: Sharing Data via ViewChild
     cons: Child wonâ€™t be available until after the view has been initialized. 
           This means we need to implement the AfterViewInit lifecycle hook to receive the data from the child.
- Child to Parent: Sharing Data via Output() and EventEmitter
- Unrelated Components: Sharing Data with a Service

1. 
    - div does not have closing tag 
      separate template for html should be used, instead of template literal,
       where this type of errors will be showed by IDE
    - calling service in constructor
        in constructor simple inilization code should be placed
        calling services should be in ngOnInit lifecycle
    - Using function in html template
        function is executed every time Angular change detection runs. 
        inside or outside of component
        should be used pipes or manually adding check in ngOnChanges if user.name changes
    - there is no error catching if component is loaded but username does not exists
    - there is no unsubscribe from the observable
            best way is to use observable directly in html template with async key
